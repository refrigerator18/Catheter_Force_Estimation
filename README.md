# Catheter_Force_Estimation
Relevant code for our paper, ["Mathematical modeling and vision-based force estimation in a planar catheter using deep learning"](https://huzaifazar.me/catheter_force_estimation.pdf)

## Code Breakdown:

  The goal of this paper was to use machine learning techniques to predict the applied forces on a simulated cathter. The code for this project is split into two major sections, image processing via OpenCV, and subsequently the machine learning process via TensorFlow.
