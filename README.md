# Catheter Force Estimation
Relevant code for our paper, ["Mathematical modelling and vision-based force estimation on a planar catheter using deep learning"](https://huzaifazar.me/catheter_force_estimation.pdf). A sample dataset is provided.

**The dataset used in the paper makes use of more complex curves.*

## Code Breakdown:

  The goal of this paper was to use machine learning techniques to predict the applied forces on a simulated catheter. The code for this project is split into three major sections, image processing via OpenCV, training via RandomForest, and training via Nueral Netwroks.
